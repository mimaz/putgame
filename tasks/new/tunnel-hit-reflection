When player hits the tunnel its flight trajectory should be reflected
due to tunnel surface normal vector. As for now it works only at start 
when the tunnel is straight. But after getting more curved the calculations
are not correct.

TODO

generate straight tunnel and confirm whether the problem has something
in common with tunnel absolute position

start with tunnel bent by a small angle and check what happens then

fix calculations in game/player.cxx / player::process()
