I implemented game rendering frame buffer as yet another
level of drawing indirection. Now we should be able to dynamically 
ajust rendering resolution to avoid decreasing real frame per second
value, save reduntancy computations and provide best quality when 
it's possible.

TODO

check if dynamic setting framebuffer size doesn't cause
other issues

measure average frame rendering time

scale resolution up or down according to rise or fall of fps
